# Hoopscope Website Code Improvements (August 2025)

## What's Included in this Update
- Replaced Gemini API AI features with OpenAI API integration
- Added secure API key handling (suggested: serverless proxy using env variables)
- Improved accessibility and semantic HTML (landmarks, alt text, ARIA where applicable)
- Added lazy image loading and fallback images
- Enhanced mobile responsiveness (grid tweaks, font sizing, buttons)
- Improved SEO (metadata, og tags, blog structure)
- Upgraded error handling for all AI-related calls
- Suggested/added new basketball analytics blog topics
- Added changelog, organized Drive folder for version history
- Provided performance tips (assets, image compression, preloading fonts)

## Where to Find Everything
- `/code` for HTML, CSS/JS, and integrations documentation
- `/content` for blog editorial, SEO, and sample posts
- `/changelog` for ongoing updates and performance notes

You must deploy server-side API proxies for all AI/LLM requests to keep API keys safe. See `AI-Integration-Plan.md` for details.
